Practicing Python codes 
I'm learning Python at the moment and wanted to use github just to store my practice codes, hence this project. I've not done coding before up until this point, and being able to create "stuff" that works according to my intention is very exciting and rewarding. 
I don't have a technical background so I fully expect this to be a challenging journey, but I'm up for it!
